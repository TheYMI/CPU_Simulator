Description: The components module defines the base classes for all the different components in the system.
             Components are further divided into subtypes with more specific behaviors.

             Each component should have a name and an ID (once set, they can't be changed).
             While running, the system works in cycles. Each cycle consists of an "up" tick that happens when the cycle
             starts, and a "down" tick that happens when the cycle ends. Components have to implement their
             functionality during those phases. Some might do nothing, which is acceptable, but it's required for
             system-wide actions.
